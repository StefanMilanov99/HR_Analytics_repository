## Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to provide comprehensive insights into various aspects of an organization's human resources. By importing an Excel file, this dashboard showcases crucial metrics related to employee demographics, promotions, job levels, tenure, and distance from the workplace. The intuitive visualizations offer a clear understanding of the workforce composition and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Key Features
1. **Employee Count Analysis**: Gain a holistic view of the organization's workforce with the total number of employees. Explore the distribution of male and female employees, both in terms of absolute numbers and percentages, to better understand the gender representation within the company.

2. **Promotion Eligibility**: Identify the number and percentage of employees eligible and not eligible for promotion. This analysis enables HR professionals and managers to evaluate career progression opportunities and develop strategies to enhance employee growth within the organization.

3. **Retention and Retrenchment**: Evaluate the current workforce situation by analyzing the number and percentage of employees currently on service and those at risk of being retrenched. This information aids in talent management and workforce planning initiatives.

4. **Job Level Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of employees across different job levels using a bar chart. This analysis provides insights into the hierarchical structure of the organization and helps identify areas where career development programs can be focused.

5. **Distance from Work**: Understand the geographical spread of employees by visualizing the total distance from their workplace using a pie chart. This data can be valuable for transportation planning, assessing the impact of commuting on employee satisfaction, and exploring potential office relocation strategies.
